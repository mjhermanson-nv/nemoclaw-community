"""Schema versioning for the ledger.

The store outlives any single version of this example, so it carries a version
and a forward-only migration path. Two properties matter more than the
migrations themselves:

  * running migrations on an up-to-date store does nothing, so every job can
    call it on startup without thinking about it;
  * a store from the future is refused rather than opened, because silently
    operating on a schema you do not understand is how data gets corrupted by
    a downgrade.

    change, which is a poor thing to discover while writing the connector.
    SQLite cannot alter a CHECK, so removing it is a table rebuild — the one
    migration shape that can lose rows, which is why the columns are named

    Detected rather than attempted: a store that already has the foreign key

    **The dependants have to be carried across by hand.** `obligations.source_id`
    references `items(source_id)` `ON DELETE CASCADE`, and with foreign keys
    enabled SQLite performs an implicit `DELETE FROM` before dropping a table
    — which fires that cascade and takes the obligations, and the events
    hanging off them, with it. Measured: a v4 store with one message, one
    obligation and one event came out of this migration with the message and
    nothing else. The audit trail is the thing the recipe promises outlives
    its subject, so losing it here would have been the worst possible place.

    Turning the pragma off does not help: SQLite ignores
    `PRAGMA foreign_keys` inside a transaction, and `defer_foreign_keys`
    defers constraint *checks* rather than cascade *actions*. All three were
    tried. The documented procedure sets the pragma before `BEGIN`, which is
    the caller's business and not something a migration step can reach.

    So the rows are saved and put back. The dependants are discovered from
    `PRAGMA foreign_key_list` rather than named here, because a table added
