Runs the collectors, then hands the agent a slice of unjudged items. When
there is nothing new it emits `{"wakeAgent": false}`, which Hermes treats as a
signal to skip the agent turn entirely — so a quiet half-hour costs no tokens
at all rather than paying a model call to be told there is no work.

    """Run whichever collectors are present, and report whether any failed.

    A collector that is absent is not an error. The store and the schedule ship
    before the connectors do, and a reader who never connects a source still
    gets a working intake pass over whatever is already in the store.

    A collector that *fails* is a different thing, and it must be visible. The
    exit code is what says so: a connector whose credential expired writes to
    stderr and exits non-zero while printing nothing, and `json.loads("" or
    "{}")` turns that into an empty success. Combined with the idle gate below
    it produced the worst failure this design can have — a token that stopped
    working, a tick that skipped the agent, and nothing anywhere saying so,
    every half hour.

    A failing collector's own output is never repeated anywhere. It is
    arbitrary text from a subprocess that talks to a mail or chat API: a
    traceback carrying a bearer token, a request URL with a signature in the
    query string, a response body full of someone's messages.

    Two places wanted it and neither may have it. This function's stdout is
    the scheduled agent's prompt, so putting it there sends it to an inference
    provider. This process's stderr is captured by the scheduler into the job
    log, so putting it there turns something transient into something stored —
    a log that outlives the token in it, on disk, for as long as logs are kept.
    Truncating bounds length rather than content; the first two hundred
    characters of a traceback are exactly where the request line is.

    So both get the same sanitized triple — collector name, exit code, stable
    error class — which is what the agent can act on and what tells an operator
    which collector to go and run by hand. Running it directly is how you read
    what it actually said, and that output goes to a terminal rather than a
    file.

    Returns the per-collector results and a flag: true if any of them failed.
