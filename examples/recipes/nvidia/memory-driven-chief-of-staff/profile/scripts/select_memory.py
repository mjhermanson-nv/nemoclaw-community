"""Cron pre-step for the memory-writing pass.

The memory is what makes this recipe more than a mail sorter: ranking reserves
its top tier for work the person has *chosen*, and only `attention/` and
`goals/` can answer that. Until something writes those pages, nothing can ever
reach `high` and the assistant is left measuring how loudly the outside world
is asking — which is the thing it exists not to do.

The other three memory jobs do not fill that gap and are not meant to. Repair
checks invariants, consolidation compacts pages that grew past their ceiling,
preference-update writes the policy. All three maintain a memory; none creates
one.

So this selects the evidence and the agent writes the pages. The split matters
for the same reason it does elsewhere in this recipe: arithmetic that can be
done in Python is not left to a prompt. Who the recurring correspondents are,
how many exchanges there have been, which of them already have a page, and
which pages have gone stale are all counting problems, answered here. Which of
them is worth a page, and what it should say, is judgment, answered by the
model.

Emits `{"wakeAgent": false}` when there is nothing new to write, so a quiet day
costs no tokens.

    - A page that records **any** of this person's identities keeps its name.
