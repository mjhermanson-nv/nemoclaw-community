"""The user's writer.

Corrections come from the user, so they cannot come from the model. The skills
forbid the agent from touching `manual_priority` or from writing an `ignored`
event, for the same reason `preference-update` refuses to read agent-authored
rows: a system that can manufacture its own evidence will eventually believe
something nobody told it.

That leaves the user needing a way in, which is this script. It is the only
thing that writes `actor='user'`, and it is what the conversational surface
calls when the user says "stop showing me these" or "this one is not urgent".

    python3 correct.py ignore <source_id> [--reason "..."]
    python3 correct.py priority <source_id> high|medium|low
    python3 correct.py unignore <source_id>

Every correction re-ranks the open population before it commits, so the effect
is visible on the next read rather than at the next scheduled pass.
