"""Deterministic checks over the memory.

Detection is mechanical, so it lives here and can be tested without a model.
Deciding what to do about a finding needs judgment, so that stays in the
repair and consolidation skills. Splitting them this way means a reviewer can
verify that the checks are right, and the skills are left with the part that
genuinely needs reading comprehension.

Every check returns findings rather than fixing anything. Nothing in this
module writes.
