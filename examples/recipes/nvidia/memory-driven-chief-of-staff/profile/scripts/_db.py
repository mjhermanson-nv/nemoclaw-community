"""SQLite access for the ledger.

Two rules, both learned from running this shape under a cron scheduler:

1. One connection per transaction, closed every time. The scheduler can run
   two jobs concurrently, and a connection held open across a model call is a
   lock held for the length of that call.
2. `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, so a writer takes the write lock up front instead of
   discovering the conflict at COMMIT and losing the work.
