Ask NemoClaw lets you ask a NemoClaw agent about the page that’s open in
Chrome. Each message includes fresh readable text and a bounded JPEG of the
visible viewport, so the agent can work with text, images, charts, and layout.
The agent decides which installed skills and tools fit your prompt.

The extension doesn’t modify the page, and it doesn’t contain a Hermes
password, inference API key, or OAuth token.

endpoint, profile, credential, or production data.

## At a glance

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| What do I get? | A Chrome side panel with isolated Hermes conversations, fresh browser context on every message, and local NeMo Relay ATIF traces. |
| Where does it run? | The NemoClaw agent and Hermes server run on a Linux host. The Ask NemoClaw extension runs in Chrome on your workstation. This guide uses the NemoClaw Brev launchable for the Linux host. |
| What was tested? | Local tests and a fresh Brev deployment using NemoClaw 0.0.123, OpenShell 0.0.106, and `nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-omni-30b-a3b-reasoning` on September 14, 2026. |
| What leaves the browser? | The active page URL, title, selected text, readable page text, visible viewport image, and your prompt go to your configured Hermes deployment and inference provider. |
| Can it take actions? | Not by itself. Tool actions still need an installed Hermes tool, its credentials, and an OpenShell policy that allows the exact destination. |
| Who maintains it? | This is an NVIDIA-authored educational example with best-effort community support. See the repository [support policy](../../../../SUPPORT.md). |

## Architecture

![Ask NemoClaw architecture showing the Chrome permission boundary, NemoClaw runtime, Hermes plugin, OpenShell controls, inference provider, optional skills, and local traces](assets/ask-nemoclaw-architecture.png)

Chrome grants temporary access to the active tab when you select the extension.
The extension sends your prompt and bounded page context to one Hermes origin
that you choose in Settings. The server plugin maps each browser conversation
to its own non-PTY Hermes session, so browser conversations also appear in the
Hermes dashboard without consuming terminal devices.

OpenShell applies runtime controls, and NeMo Relay writes local ATIF traces.
The extension has no built-in deployment hostname. Chrome asks you to grant
access to the exact origin you configure, and changing origins removes the old
permission.

For the Brev quick start, the authenticated Brev CLI tunnel is the access
boundary and Hermes stays bound to loopback. Shared deployments should use an
authenticated HTTPS ingress instead. See [Security and data](docs/security.md)
for the full trust model.

## Before you start

You’ll need:

- a fresh instance from the
  [NemoClaw Brev launchable](https://brev.nvidia.com/launchable/deploy/now?launchableID=env-3Azt0aYgVNFEuz7opyx3gscmowS);
- Chrome 116 or newer on your workstation;
- the Brev CLI on your workstation; and
- an inference provider API key.

This guide sends the active page context to the inference provider you select.
Make sure that provider is approved for the pages you plan to use. Local ATIF
traces also contain prompts, page context, model output, and tool events, so
treat them as sensitive data.

## Quick start

### 1. Create a fresh Brev host

Create one instance from the launchable, but **don’t run the launchable’s web
onboarding flow**. The steps below update NemoClaw, prepare the custom Hermes
image, and then create the only sandbox this example needs.

Connect to the instance and confirm that NemoClaw lists no sandboxes:

```bash
nemoclaw status
```

### 2. Prepare the host

Some launchable versions use Docker’s containerd snapshotter, which doesn’t
support the nested overlay mounts needed by an OpenShell sandbox. Check it:

```bash
docker info --format 'Driver={{.Driver}} Status={{json .DriverStatus}}'
```

If the output contains `io.containerd.snapshotter.v1`, switch this fresh host
to `overlay2`:

```bash
printf '%s\n' \
  '{' \
  '  "features": {' \
  '    "containerd-snapshotter": false' \
  '  }' \
  '}' \
  | sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json >/dev/null
sudo systemctl restart docker
docker info --format 'Driver={{.Driver}} Status={{json .DriverStatus}}'
```

The result should report `Driver=overlay2`.

Review the NemoClaw license and third-party software notice before running the
next command. By setting the acceptance variable, you confirm that you accept
those terms. The command updates NemoClaw without starting onboarding because
it removes inference credentials from the installer process:

```bash
cd /tmp
curl -fsSL https://www.nvidia.com/nemoclaw.sh \
  | env -u NVIDIA_INFERENCE_API_KEY -u NVIDIA_API_KEY \
      NEMOCLAW_AGENT=hermes \
      NEMOCLAW_NON_INTERACTIVE=1 \
      NEMOCLAW_ACCEPT_THIRD_PARTY_SOFTWARE=1 \
      bash
```

Refresh your command path:

```bash
source "$HOME/.bashrc"
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
command -v nemoclaw nemohermes openshell
nemoclaw --version
openshell --version
```

Now clone the community repository and run the guarded Brev gateway handoff:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/nemoclaw-community.git
cd nemoclaw-community/examples/recipes/nvidia/browser-context-knowledge-assistant
bash scripts/prepare-brev-gateway.sh
bash scripts/check-brev-host.sh
```

The handoff stops only the empty legacy gateway and lets the updated NemoClaw
installation own the new gateway. It refuses to continue if it finds a sandbox.
For details and troubleshooting, see [Brev setup](docs/brev.md).

### 3. Create the Hermes sandbox

Run the recipe’s onboarding script:

```bash
bash scripts/onboard.sh --fresh
```

Enter your inference credential through the normal NemoClaw prompt. For
viewport understanding, select
`nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-omni-30b-a3b-reasoning` as the primary model. This is
needed because NemoClaw and OpenShell currently expose one enforced inference
route to Hermes. Hermes auxiliary vision expects a separate model route, so it
doesn’t work with this recipe’s current single-route setup. Secure multi-model
OpenShell routing, including Switchyard integration, is tracked in
[NVIDIA/NemoClaw#8887](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/issues/8887). Until
that support is available, the primary model must accept image input. A
text-only primary model can still use readable page text, but it can’t analyze
the viewport image.

When onboarding finishes, check the sandbox:

```bash
nemohermes ask-nemoclaw status
nemohermes ask-nemoclaw dashboard-url --quiet
```

Don’t configure Hermes dashboard authentication for this loopback Brev quick
start. The authenticated Brev CLI tunnel provides access to the local dashboard.

### 4. Forward Hermes to your workstation

This step is only needed when Hermes is bound to loopback on the Brev host.
Skip it if your workstation can already reach Hermes directly or if a
Kubernetes deployment exposes Hermes through an authenticated HTTPS ingress.
In those environments, configure the extension with the reachable Hermes URL.

On the workstation where Chrome is installed, keep this command running:

```bash
brev port-forward <brev-instance-name> -p 18789:18789
```

Verify the forwarded service from the example directory:

```bash
bash scripts/check-connection.sh http://127.0.0.1:18789
```

The final lines should report HTTP 200 for the Ask NemoClaw API and
`Loopback development connection is ready`.

If local port `18789` is already in use, map another local port:

```bash
brev port-forward <brev-instance-name> -p 18790:18789
```

Then use `http://127.0.0.1:18790` in the extension. Don’t use a Brev Secure
Link as the extension URL; its redirect-based login flow isn’t an API ingress.

### 5. Load the Chrome extension

Download the
[prebuilt portable extension](release/ask-nemoclaw-extension-0.10.12.zip) and
extract the ZIP file. It contains no deployment URL or credential.

Then load the extracted directory:

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Select **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the extracted `ask-nemoclaw-extension` directory.
5. Pin **Ask NemoClaw** to the Chrome toolbar.
6. Open the side panel and enter `http://127.0.0.1:18789` in Settings.
7. Approve Chrome’s request for that exact origin and confirm the status says
   **Connected to NemoClaw**.

You only need to install the extension once. Use the Settings gear to switch
deployments later. Contributors can build the same portable package from source
with `python3 scripts/build-extension-release.py`.

## Use Ask NemoClaw

1. Make sure the Brev port forward is running, then open the Ask NemoClaw side
   panel and confirm it says **Connected to NemoClaw**. For another deployment,
   open Settings and enter its reachable Hermes URL.
2. Open a normal HTTP or HTTPS page.
3. Select the **Ask NemoClaw** toolbar icon.
4. Enter any prompt and select **Send**.

Every message recaptures the available page text and visible viewport. The
page doesn’t need readable DOM text if Chrome can capture a valid viewport
image. After changing tabs, select the toolbar icon on the new tab before
selecting **Refresh**; this grants temporary access to that tab.

The agent chooses skills from your prompt, not from the page URL. For example,
a Google Docs skill is used only when it’s installed, authorized, allowed by
OpenShell policy, and relevant to what you ask.

The connection indicator shows whether Hermes is ready, needs authentication,
or is unavailable. **Open NemoClaw** opens the dashboard, and the Settings gear
contains connection and disconnect controls. Shared HTTPS deployments use the
normal Hermes login. The extension keeps rotated session tokens only in
Chrome’s memory-backed session storage.

Multimodal requests over large pages can take several minutes. The side panel
keeps polling and shows the current request stage while Hermes works.

## Verify the example

Run the local test suite:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements-test.txt
PYTHON_BIN=.venv/bin/python bash scripts/verify.sh
```

For a quick live check:

1. Open a public page with readable text and a distinctive image or diagram.
2. Ask for a short summary and a description of what’s visible.
3. Send a follow-up question and confirm that it keeps the conversation.
4. Select **New** and confirm that the new conversation starts without the old context.
5. Open Hermes **Sessions** and confirm that both browser conversations appear.
6. Check `/sandbox/.hermes-data/nemo-relay/atif` for a new trace file. Don’t
   inspect trace values when the page contains sensitive data.

NeMo Relay keeps these ATIF JSON traces inside the sandbox. From the NemoClaw
host, list their filenames without printing their contents:

```bash
nemohermes ask-nemoclaw exec -- \
  find /sandbox/.hermes-data/nemo-relay/atif \
    -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.json' -printf '%f\n'
```

To copy the traces to the host for an authorized review:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/ask-nemoclaw-traces"
openshell sandbox download \
  ask-nemoclaw \
  /sandbox/.hermes-data/nemo-relay/atif \
  "$HOME/ask-nemoclaw-traces"
chmod -R go-rwx "$HOME/ask-nemoclaw-traces"
```

On Brev, copy that directory to your workstation from a local terminal:

```bash
brev copy \
  <instance-name>:/home/ubuntu/ask-nemoclaw-traces \
  "$HOME/Downloads/"
```

Treat the downloaded files as sensitive because they can contain the prompt,
browser context, model output, and tool events.

See [Development and verification](docs/development.md) for the complete test
matrix and shared-deployment reference.

## Limitations

- The image includes only the visible viewport, not off-screen content, other
  tabs, Chrome’s toolbar, or the full accessibility tree.
- Chrome’s `activeTab` permission requires a toolbar click on each new tab.
- Google Workspace access needs a separate skill or tool, authorization, and
  exact OpenShell egress policy.
- Separating the user prompt from page content reduces prompt-injection risk,
  but it doesn’t make untrusted content safe by itself.
- ATIF traces contain sensitive context until the operator removes them. This
  example doesn’t include an automatic retention policy.
- Central Chrome distribution requires standard Chrome Enterprise packaging
  and policy management outside this repository.

## Cleanup

Stop the sandbox without deleting its state:

```bash
nemohermes ask-nemoclaw stop
```

The next command permanently removes the sandbox and its workspace after a
confirmation prompt:

```bash
nemohermes ask-nemoclaw destroy
```

Stop or delete the Brev instance separately when you’re finished.
